To run a specific module's demonstrations:

```bash
python main.py --module basics      # Run Fourier basics demos
python main.py --module convolution # Run convolution theorem demos
python main.py --module diffraction # Run diffraction imaging demos
python main.py --module lensless    # Run lensless imaging demos
```

You can also import and use individual functions from each module:

```python
from fourier_basics import plot_image_and_spectrum
from convolution_theorem import demonstrate_convolution_theorem
from diffraction_imaging import demonstrate_fraunhofer_diffraction
from lensless_imaging import demonstrate_in_line_holography

# ... your code here ...
```

## Key Concepts

### Fourier Transform in Optics

The Fourier transform is used to decompose an image into its spatial frequency components, providing insights into the image's structure and facilitating various operations in the frequency domain.

### Convolution Theorem

The convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of a convolution of two functions is equal to the product of their individual Fourier transforms:

F{f * g} = F{f} Â· F{g}

This principle allows efficient computation of convolution operations and is central to understanding how optical systems process images.

### Diffraction

Diffraction is the bending of waves around obstacles. In optics, it plays a crucial role in determining the resolution limits of imaging systems. The two main regimes are:

- **Fraunhofer diffraction**: Applies when the observation distance is much larger than the aperture size (far field)
- **Fresnel diffraction**: Applies when the observation distance is comparable to the aperture size (near field)

### Lensless Imaging

Lensless imaging techniques use computational methods to recover images without traditional lenses, often utilizing:

- Diffraction patterns
- Phase information
- Specially designed coded apertures
- Holographic principles
